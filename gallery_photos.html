            <h3>With Real Madrid</h3>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is a part of Real Madrid's legacy and will forever be remember as one of the great icons throughout the club's history. He was unveiled at the Santiago Bernabéu on 6 July 2009, where he was joined by Eusebio and Alfredo Di Stéfano, and since that day, the goals just kept coming.

            <h3>Beginning of His Career</h3>
            <p>he first goal that Cristiano Ronaldo scored on the big stage was a remarkable one. In a game between Sporting Lisbon and Moreirense on Oct 7, 2002, the 17-year-old took Moreirense’s goalkeeper by surprise. Just as is typical for the iconic athlete, one goal wasn’t enough for his debut, and he ended up scoring two goals in the 3-0 victory at Sporting’s old stadium.</p>

            <p>The Serie A champions saw fit to fork out €100 million (£88m/$117m) for the 34-year-old for a number of reasons, but chief among those is his incredible capacity to find the back of the net.</p>
